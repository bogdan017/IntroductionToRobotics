Introduction to Robotics course, part of the 3rd-year curriculum at the Faculty of Computer Science, University of Bucharest, offers a comprehensive exploration of the field of robotics through hands-on projects and homework. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image/video files.
## Homework 2
Task Requirements:

Using 3 potentiometers and 1 RGB LED, we have to control each one of the RGB LED colors with a separate potentiometer. Each value that is read from the potentiometers must be mapped to values that will be used as input for the RGB LED.

Materials used: 

- 3 x potentiometer
- 1 x RGB LED
- 3 x 100 ohm resistors
- wires

## Homework 3
Task Requirements:

Using 3 LEDs resembling 3 floors and 1 LED for the elevator state, simulate the movement of an elevator between 3 floors by pushing a button for each one of them. The elvator should make a sound when the doors are closing, another sound when it is moving and one for arriving at the desired floor.

Materials used:
- 4 x LED
- 3 x Push Buttons
- 5 x 220 ohm resistors
- 1 buzzer
- wires

## Homework 4
Task Requirements:

Using a joystick and a 7 segment display implement a mini game where you can move between the leds of the 7 segment display and when you short press the joystick's button you can toggle the state of the current led. A long press will reset the display.

Materials used: 
- 1 x joystick
- 1 x 7 segment display
- 8 x 220 ohm resistors
- wires

## Homework 5
Task Requirements: 
Using a 4 digit 7 segment display and 3 buttons implement a stopwatch that can start/pause, reset and cycle through laps. Reset will only take effect when pause mode is active and a second press will delete the lap memory. Also the lap memory can cycle through the last 4 laps.

Materials used: 
- 1 x 4 digit 7 segment display
- 3 x push buttons
- 8 x 220 ohm resistors
- 1 x shift register 74HC595N
- wires

## Homework 6
Task Requirements:
Using an ultrasonic sensor, one LDR and one RGB LED, make a complete menu from where a user can choose an option between these 4: input sensor settings, reset logged data, system status and RGB LED control. Each of these has a submenu with other options that the user can access by introducing a number.

Materials used:
- 1 x ultrasonic sensor
- 1 x LDR
- 1 x RGB LED
- 1 x 10k ohm resistor
- 3 x 220 ohm resistors
- wires
