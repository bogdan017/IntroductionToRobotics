# IntroductionToRobotics
Introduction to Robotics course, part of the 3rd-year curriculum at the Faculty of Computer Science, University of Bucharest, offers a comprehensive exploration of the field of robotics through hands-on projects and homework. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image/video files.
## Homework 2
Task Requirements:

Using 3 potentiometers and 1 RGB LED, we have to control each one of the RGB LED colors with a separate potentiometer. Each value that is read from the potentiometers must be mapped to values that will be used as input for the RGB LED.

Materials used: 

- 3 x potentiometer
- 1 x RGB LED
- 3 x 100 ohm resistors
- wires

## Homework 3
Task Requirements:

Using 3 LEDs resembling 3 floors and 1 LED for the elevator state, simulate the movement of an elevator between 3 floors by pushing a button for each one of them. The elvator should make a sound when the doors are closing, another sound when it is moving and one for arriving at the desired floor.

Materials used:
- 4 x LED
- 3 x Push Buttons
- 5 x 220 ohm resistors
- 1 buzzer
- wires

## Homework 4
Task Requirements:

Using a joystick and a 7 segment display implement a mini game where you can move between the leds of the 7 segment display and when you short press the joystick's button you can toggle the state of the current led. A long press will reset the display.

Materials used: 
- 1 x joystick
- 1 x 7 segment display
- 8 x 220 ohm resistors
- wires
